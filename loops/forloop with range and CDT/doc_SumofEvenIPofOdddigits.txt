# find sum of even index positions of odd digits present in a string


1. Take input from the user and store it in the variable called s
2. by assuming if the user given str does not contain any digits or does not have any odd digits so sum is initilized with 0
3.we need to add index positions so we need to consider for loop with the range and CDT
4. for loop range will be in between 0 to length of s
5. if s[ip].isdigit():
        if int(s[ip]) % 2 != 0 and ip % 2 == 0:
            sum += ip

inside for loop we need condition to check any digit is present in the given str 
if true then enter into if block then another if condtion to check that digit is odd or not and ip is even or not.
    if the digit is odd and ip is even then enter into nested if block and sum will be added to sum = sum + ip
6. assume s = 've123'

 -- in the first iteration the ip will be assign with 0 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'v' and it is not digit so condition false, sum value will be 0.
 -- in the 2nd iteration the ip will be assign with 1 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'e' and it  not is digit so condition false, sum will be 0. 
 -- in the 3rd iteration the ip will be assign with 2 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract '1' and it is digit so condition true, 
    nested condition 1 is  odd and ip value 2 is even so condition true, sum will be 2.
 -- in the 4th iteration the ip will be assign with 3 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract '2' and it is digit so condition true, 
    nested condition 2 is not  odd condition false, sum will be 2.
 -- in the 5th iteration the ip will be assign with 4 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract '3' and it is digit so condition true, 
    nested condition 3 is  odd and ip value is 4 even condition true, sum will be 6.

7. after complition of iterations the controller will come out of the loop, there we need to print the sum.
