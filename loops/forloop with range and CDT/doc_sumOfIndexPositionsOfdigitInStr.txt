# find the sum of index positions of digits in given string

1. Take input from the user and store it in the variable called s
2. by assuming if the user given str does not contain any digit, so sum is initilized with 0
3.we need to add index positions so we need to consider for loop with the range and CDT
4. for loop range will be in between 0 to length of s
5. if s[ip].isdigit 
    inside for loop we need condition to check any digit is present in the given str by extract single char with loop variable ip
    if that condition is true then sum will be incremented.
6. assume s = 'v123'

 -- in the first iteration the ip will be assign with 0 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'v' and it is not digit so condition false, sum value will be 0.
-- in the 2nd iteration the ip will be assign with 1 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract '1' and it is digit so condition true, sum value will be 1.
-- in the 3rd iteration the ip will be assign with 2 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract '2' and it is digit so condition true, sum value will be 3.
-- in the 4th iteration the ip will be assign with 3 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract '3' and it is digit so condition true, sum value will be 6.

7. after complition of iterations the controller will come out of the loop, there we need to print the sum.
