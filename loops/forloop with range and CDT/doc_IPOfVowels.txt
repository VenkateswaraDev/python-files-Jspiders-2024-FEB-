1.Take input String from the user and store it in the variable s
2. store all Vowels in a variable v to compair with the given str s
3.We need to find index positions of Vowels so we are considering for loop with the range and CDT
4. in that for loop the range will be upto the length of the collection
5. for loop will start with 0 which is assign to a variable called ip to track range 
6. inside for loop there is a condition
 if (s[ip] in v ) we are checking if the given String is present in the v variable or not if yes then the ip will be prented.
7. for example take s = 'venky' and v = 'AEIOUaeiou'
-- in the first iteration the ip will be assign with 0 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'v' so 'v' is not present in v variable.
-- in the 2nd iteration ip will become 1 and check the condition s[ip] that means 'e'
    so 'e' is present in the variable v, so enter into if block print that index position ip.
-- in the 3rd iteration the ip will be assign with 2 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'n' so 'n' is not present in v variable.
-- in the 4th iteration the ip will be assign with 3 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'k' so 'k' is not present in v variable.
-- in the 5th iteration the ip will be assign with 4 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'y' so 'y' is not present in v variable.
