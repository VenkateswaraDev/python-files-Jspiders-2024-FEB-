to print the index positions of consonents present in the given string

1.Take input String from the user and store it in the variable s
2. store all Vowels in a variable v to compair with the given str s
3.We need to find index positions of consonents so we are considering for loop with the range and CDT
4. in that for loop the range will be upto the length of the collection
5. for loop will start with 0 which is assign to a variable called ip to track range 
6. inside for loop there is a condition
 if (s[ip].isalpha and s[ip] not in v ) we are checking if the given String char is alpha or not and that char is present in the v variable or not if yes then the ip will be print.
7. for example take s = 'venky' and v = 'AEIOUaeiou'
-- in the first iteration the ip will be assign with 0 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'v' and it is alpha and so 'v' is not present in v variable
    then enter into if block print the index position ip.
-- in the 2nd iteration ip will become 1 and check the condition s[ip] that means 'e' is alpha and
    so 'e' is present in the variable v,so if condition false.
-- in the 3rd iteration the ip will be assign with 2 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'n' is alpha and so 'n' is not present in v variable
     then enter into if block print the index position ip.
-- in the 4th iteration the ip will be assign with 3 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'k' is alpha and so 'k' is not present in v variable
     then enter into if block print the index position ip.
-- in the 5th iteration the ip will be assign with 4 and enter into the loop and in the loop 
    there is condition s[ip] means it will extract 'y' is alpha and so 'y' is not present in v variable
     then enter into if block print the index position ip.
