Explaination doc to check how many elements present in given str

    s=input("Enter a string = ")
1.Taking input string from the user and stored in the variable called s.
    count=0
2. initilized a variable named count to track the count of elements,
  0 is assign because if user given string is empty then it will return 0.
    for i in s:
3. starting a for loop to iterate the elements present in the string(s) by using i variable,
if the user given string is not empty controller will enter into the loop.
    count +=1
4. in a loop we are incrementing the count variable by the iteration count.

* assume if user given string is 'venky'
- 1st itteeration i will be assigned as first element in str as v and count will be updated to 1 
- 1st itteeration i will be assigned as first element in str as e and count will be updated to 1+1 
- 1st itteeration i will be assigned as first element in str as n and count will be updated to 2+1 
- 1st itteeration i will be assigned as first element in str as k and count will be updated to 3+1 
- 1st itteeration i will be assigned as first element in str as y and count will be updated to 4+1

After all the elements will be done then it will come out of the for loop and go to next statement.

    print(count)
5. This print count will be return outside the loop because count value will be returned at the end onces only,
if we will given inside the loop then it will print every time or every iteration, to avoid that we need to given that statemnet outside the loop.

6. by this we can find number of elements present in the given string...
