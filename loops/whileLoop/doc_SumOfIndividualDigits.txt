1.Take a input from the user and store in n
2. assume user given 0 so initilizing sum variable as 0
3. starting a while loop with condition n != 0

assume num = 123

if while condition satisfy then 

-- 1st iteration n%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 3 stored in d and sum value will become 3.
    n will be updated to n//10, 12
-- 2nd iteration n%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 2 stored in d and sum value will become 3+2.
    n will be updated to n//10, 1
-- 3rd iteration n%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 1 stored in d and sum value will become 5+1.
    n will be updated to n//10, 0
--4th iteration condition fail comes out of the loop

4. outside the loop print sum.
