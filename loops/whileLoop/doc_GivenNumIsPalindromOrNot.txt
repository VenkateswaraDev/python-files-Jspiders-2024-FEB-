1.Take a input from the user and store in n
2. assume user given 0 so initilizing rev variable as 0
3. initilizing i = 0
3. starting a while loop with condition n != 0

assume num = 121

if while condition satisfy then 

-- 1st iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 1 stored in rem and rev = rev*10+d value will become 1.
    i will be updated to n//10, 12
 --2nd iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 2 stored in rem and rev = rev*10+d value will become 21.
    i will be updated to n//10, 1
--  3rd iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 1 stored in rem and rev = rev*10+d value will become 121.
    i will be updated to n//10, 0
--4th iteration condition fail comes out of the loop

4. outside the loop check condition rem == num if condition true then print "plaindrom".
5. else print('not a plaindrom')
