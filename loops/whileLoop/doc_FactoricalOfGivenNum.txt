Factorial of given number by using while loop

1. Take int input from the user and store it in the num variable
2. Assume that user enter 0 as input so Factorial of 0 will 1, thats the region we are initilizing fact variable with 0
3. we need an starting value to strat the loop so iam taking i = 2
note :- if user enter negative numbers then we need to tell user to enter only positive numbers for that we need to write if-else condition

4. if the given number is grater than and equal to 0 enter into 
while loop condition will be i<=num, then i value will be comparied to that condition
5.if condition true fact value will be multiply with i value
6.we need to write loop stoping statement other wise it will be infinite loop
7.i value will be incremented by 1 every time it enters into the loop.
8. Assume user given input as 4

- in the 1st iteration i will be 2 and (i<=num) condition true fact value will become 2 and i value will become 3
- in the 2nd iteration i will be 3 and (i<=num) condition true fact value will become 6 and i value will become 4
- in the 3rd iteration i will be 4 and (i<=num) condition true fact value will become 24 and i value will become 5
- in the 6th iteration i will be 5 and (i<=num) condition false.

exit loop

9. outside the loop we need to print fact value.

10. if condition false then enter into else block and print else block statement(enter positive numbers only).
