1.Take a input from the user and store in n
2. assume user given 0 so initilizing sum variable as 0
3. initilizing i = n
3. starting a while loop with condition i != 0

assume num = 121

if while condition satisfy then 

-- 1st iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 1 stored in rem and sum = sum + rem value will become 1.
    i will be updated to n//10, 12 
 --2nd iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 2 stored in rem and sum = sum + rem value will become 3.
    i will be updated to n//10, 1 
--  3rd iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 1 stored in rem and sum = sum + rem value will become 4.
    i will be updated to n//10, 0 
--4th iteration condition fail comes out of the loop

4. outside the loop check condition n % sum == 0 if condition true then print "Harshad number".
5. else print('not a Harshad number')
