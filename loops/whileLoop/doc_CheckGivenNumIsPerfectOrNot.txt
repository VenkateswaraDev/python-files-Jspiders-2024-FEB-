Check the given number is perfect number or not?

1. Take number input from the user and store in the variable called num.
2. assume if the user given number doesnot have any divisiers so initilizing ds variable with 0.
3. initilizing i with 1 to to track loop variable
4.while condition i<=num//2
5. in loop if condition num%i==0
6. if condition is true then ds will be added with i 
7. while condition failure statement, i will be incremented

assume user given 4 as input

- 1st iteration i will be 1 and check the condition i<=num//2, true 
    again check if condition num%1==0 true, so ds value will become 1 and i value will become 2.
- 2nd iteration i will be 2 and check the condition i<=num//2, true 
    again check if condition num%1==0 true, so ds value will become 3 and i value will become 3.
- 3rd iteration i will be 3 and check the condition i<=num//2, fasle

8. after complition of loop we need to check ds == num if true then it is a perfect number other wise not.
9. ds will be 3 so ds is not equal to num
10. 4 is not a perfect number
