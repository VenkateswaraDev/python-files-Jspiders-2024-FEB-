# swap the list elements with there adjusting index with out using slicing

L = [11,20,12,45,67,89]

1. initilizing i with 0 to starting position of the loop
2.while condition i<len(L)-1 if condition satisfy then enter into loop and swap the values by using indexing
3. increment i with 2
4. after complition of loop print L.
