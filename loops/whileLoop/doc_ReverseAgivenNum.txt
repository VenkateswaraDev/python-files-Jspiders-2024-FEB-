1.Take a input from the user and store in n
2. assume user given 0 so initilizing sum variable as 0
3. initilizing rev = 0
3. starting a while loop with condition n != 0

assume num = 123

if while condition satisfy then 

-- 1st iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 3 stored in d and rev = rev*10+d value will become 3.
    i will be updated to n//10, 12
 --2nd iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 2 stored in d and rev = rev*10+d value will become 32.
    i will be updated to n//10, 1
--  3rd iteration i%10 will extract last digit or rem in the given number 1 stored in d and rev = rev*10+d value will become 321.
    i will be updated to n//10, 0
--4th iteration condition fail comes out of the loop

4. outside the loop print rev.
