To find the sum of the first N natural numbers

1. Take input from the user to know the N value
num = int(input("Enter a number to print natural number upto = "))

2. nsum = 0
BY assuming is the user given N number as 0 then we need to return 0

3. starting a for loop in the range of 1 to N+1 (N is user given number)
for every iteration the sum value will be updated by the below statement
nsum +=i

Asumme if the user given N value as 5 

for loop range will in between 1 to 6

- 1st iteration i value will be 1 and nsum will become = 1
- 2nd iteration i value will be 2 and nsum will become = 3
- 3rd iteration i value will be 3 and nsum will become = 6
- 4th iteration i value will be 4 and nsum will become = 10
- 5th iteration i value will be 5 and nsum will become = 15

4. outside loop we need to print that nsum value .
