# Find every 3rd even number in between the given range
even number in range of 1 to 10 (2,4,6,8,10) i need to print only (6)

1. Taking starting and ending range values from the user by using input 
start_range = int(input("Enter a starting range number = "))
end_range = int(input("Enter a ending range number = "))

2. By observing problem i need to print even sequences of extracted even numbers so to track i need a variables
so i intilized with count = 0 

3.start a for loop in range of start_range to end_range+1

for i in range(start_range,end_range+1):

3. inside a loop a if condition to find number is even or not, if true we need to increse the count value by 1

count +=1

4. inside even if condition another if condition to check the count is divisible by 3 or not if even print i
 if i%2==0:
        count +=1
        if count % 3 ==0:
            print(i)

4. Assume user entered start_range as 1 and end_range as 10 then the for loop will be run like below steps

-- 1st iteration i will be assigned to 1 and enter into loop checks if condition 1%2==0 (false), count value is 0
-- 2nd iteration i will be assigned to 2 and enter into loop checks if condition 2%2==0 (True), count value is 1
-- 3rd iteration i will be assigned to 3 and enter into loop checks if condition 3%2==0 (false), count value is 1
-- 4th iteration i will be assigned to 4 and enter into loop checks if condition 4%2==0 (True), count value is 2
-- 5th iteration i will be assigned to 5 and enter into loop checks if condition 5%2==0 (false), count value is 2
-- 6th iteration i will be assigned to 6 and enter into loop checks if condition 6%2==0 (True), count value is 3
-- 7th iteration i will be assigned to 7 and enter into loop checks if condition 7%2==0 (false), count value is 3
-- 8th iteration i will be assigned to 8 and enter into loop checks if condition 8%2==0 (True), count value is 4
-- 9th iteration i will be assigned to 9 and enter into loop checks if condition 9%2==0 (false), count value is 4
-- 10th iteration i will be assigned to 10 and enter into loop checks if condition 10%2==0 (True), count value is 5

5. nested if count is divisible by 3 then it we need to print i.

then output will be 
6
