# Find even number in between the given range
1. Taking starting and ending range values from the user by using input and stored in variables called start_range and end_range
start_range = int(input("Enter a starting range number = "))
end_range = int(input("Enter a ending range number = "))

2. start a for loop in range of start_range to end_range+1

for i in range(start_range,end_range+1):

3. inside a loop a if condition to find number is even or not, if true we need to print i

if i%2==0:

4. Assume user entered start_range as 1 and end_range as 5 then the for loop will be run like below steps

-- 1st iteration i will be assigned to 1 and enter into loop checks if condition 1%2==0 (false)
-- 2nd iteration i will be assigned to 2 and enter into loop checks if condition 2%2==0 (True) then print i
-- 3rd iteration i will be assigned to 3 and enter into loop checks if condition 3%2==0 (false)
-- 4th iteration i will be assigned to 4 and enter into loop checks if condition 4%2==0 (True) then print i
-- 5th iteration i will be assigned to 5 and enter into loop checks if condition 5%2==0 (false)
