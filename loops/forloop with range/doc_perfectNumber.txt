To find given number is a perfect number or not
perfect number :- when a number is equal's to its sum of its divisiors then we can call theat number is perfect number.

1. Take a number from user and store in the variable name num.
num = int(input("Enter a number to check perfect number or not = "))

2. By assume if the user given number that does not contain any divisors, then i need to return 0
divisorSum = 0

3. starting an for loop to iterate the variable value and check the conditions inside loop

for i in range (1,(num//2+1),1):
here the range  will be 1 to num /2 +1(if the given number grater than half of the number will not be divisors of thet number)

4.if num%i==0:
        divisorSum += i
inside loop if condition to check given number is true divisible by i (here i is range 1 to (n/2)+1)
if condition is true we need to add that numbers to find sum, so we need to add that values to divisorSum.

--  1st itteeration i will be assigned as 1 and check if condition true then divisorSum will be updated to divisorSum+i
--  2nd itteeration i will be assigned as 2 and check if condition true then divisorSum will be updated to divisorSum+i
--  3st itteeration i will be assigned as 1 and check if condition False then divisorSum will be remain same.
-- this itteeration will be done upto end range value.

5.if divisorSum == num:
    print(f'{num} is a perfect number') 
else:
    print(f'{num} is not a perfect number') 
outside the loop we need check if the divisorSum equal to given number then it is a perfect number else not a perfect number.
