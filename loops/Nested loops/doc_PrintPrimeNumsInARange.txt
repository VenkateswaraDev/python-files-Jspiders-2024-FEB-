# Print prime Numbers In A Given range

1. Take lower limit number input from the user and store in the ll variable.
2. Take Upper limit number input from the user and store in the ul variable.
3. I need to extract every number in between the range of numbers, so i preffer to use forloop with the range of (ll,ul+1)
4. i need to check if the extracted num is divides with any other number in the inner loop with the range(2,num//2+1).
6. if the num is divisible with the loop range then Break the loop, else print num 

Assume user given ll as 2 and ul 3

outer forloop with num variable and the range of(2,3+1)
-- 1st iteration of outer loop, num variable will be 2, and check the if condition num>1 true enter into the loop.
    nested forloop with the range(2,2//2+1)
    controller will not enter into the loop, so for loop not break anywhere
    so else block will be extracted, then print num 2


-- 1st iteration of outer loop, num variable will be 3, and check the if condition num>1 true enter into the loop.
    nested forloop with the range(2,3//2+1)
    controller will not enter into the loop, so for loop not break anywhere
    so else block will be extracted, then print num 3
