# Print perfect Numbers In A Given range

1. Take lower limit number input from the user and store in the ll variable.
2. Take Upper limit number input from the user and store in the ul variable.
3. I need to extract every number in between the range of numbers, so i preffer to use forloop with the range of (ll,ul+1)
4. sum variable will be initilized with 0 because if user given 0 as input to the ll and ul.
5. i need to find divisors of extracted num so i preffer to use for loop with range of(1,num//2+1)
6. if the num is divisible with the loop range then i need to increment the sum variable with sum + I
7. After compilition of inner loop we need to check the num == sum if True then print that num.

Assume user given ll as 5 and ul 6

outer forloop with num variable and the range of(5,6+1)
-- 1st iteration of outer loop, num variable will be 5, sum will be initilized with 0.
    nested forloop with the range(1,5//2+1)
    -- 1st iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 1, then check the if condition 5%1==0 true, sum will become 1
    -- 2nd iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 2, then check the if condition 5%2==0 False, sum will be 1
    -- 3rd iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 3, then check the if condition 5%3==0 False, sum will be 1
    After complition of inner loop controller will move to out of innerloop and move to next statment
Check the if condition num == sum, here num will be 5 and sum will be 1, so condition fail

-- 2nd iteration of outer loop, num variable will be 6, sum will be initilized with 0.
    nested forloop with the range(1,6//2+1)
    -- 1st iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 1, then check the if condition 6%1==0 true, sum will become 1
    -- 2nd iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 2, then check the if condition 6%2==0 True, sum will become 3
    -- 3rd iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 3, then check the if condition 6%3==0 True, sum will become 6
    -- 4th iteration of inner loop, i will be initilized with 4, then check the if condition 6%4==0 False, sum will be 6
    After complition of inner loop controller will move to out of innerloop and move to next statment
Check the if condition num == sum, here num will be 6 and sum will be 6, so condition True, then enter into if block print Num 6.

outer loop iterations completed.
