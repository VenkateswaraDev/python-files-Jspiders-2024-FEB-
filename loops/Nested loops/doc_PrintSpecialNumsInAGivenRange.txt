# Print Special numbers in a given range 
1. Take a lower limit number from the user and store in the ll.
2. Take a upper limit number from the user and store in the ul.
3. Here i need to extract the numbers in between the range so iam prefering forloop with the range of (ll,ul+1)
4. if the number is graterthan 0 then enter into the if block 
5. then num will be stored in i 
6. sum will be initilized with the 0
7. we need to extract the single elements from the num, so i preffer while loop with the condition of i>0
8. then we need to extract last digit of the num by performing % 10 and stored in r variable
9. here fact will be initilized with 1 to store the factores of the number
10. again we need to find the factores of the extracted number, for that we need to take forloop
with the range of (1,r+1)
11.then fact = fact * j
12. need to sum the factores
13. write a statement to break the while loop condition i = i//10
14. then finally compaire the num value with the sum if that is true then print num else skip.


Assume ll = 145 and ul = 145
-- in the 1st iteration of outer loop num value will become 145 and enter into the outer loop if num is graterthan 0 then enter into 
if block, i will be initilized with the num and sum will be 0
    -- enter into the inner while loop and check the condition i>o (i will be 145>0 ) true 
        -- r will be initilized with i%10 (145%10 then it will give 5)
        --fact will be initilized with 1
        -- again entering into forloop with the range(1,r+1), here r is 5
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 1st iteration fact = fact * j, here 1*2 = 2
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 2nd iteration fact = fact * j, here 1*1 = 1
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 3rd iteration fact = fact * j, here 2*3 = 6
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 4th iteration fact = fact * j, here 6*4 = 24
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 5th iteration fact = fact * j, here 24*5 = 120
            --After complition of nested forloop controller will come to next statement
        sum = sum + fact (here sum is 0 ) 0+120, so sum will become 120
        i will become reduced based on (i= i//10) i value will be 14
        -- again while condition will be checked i>0 true , so enter into the inner while loop

         -- r will be initilized with i%10 (14%10 then it will give 4)
        --fact will be initilized with 1
        -- again entering into forloop with the range(1,r+1), here r is 4
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 1st iteration fact = fact * j, here 1*2 = 2
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 2nd iteration fact = fact * j, here 1*1 = 1
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 3rd iteration fact = fact * j, here 2*3 = 6
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 4th iteration fact = fact * j, here 6*4 = 24
            --After complition of nested forloop controller will come to next statement
        sum = sum + fact (here sum is 120 ) 120+24, so sum will become 144
         i will become reduced based on (i= i//10) i value will be 1

        -- again while condition will be checked i>0 true , so enter into the inner while loop
        
        -- r will be initilized with i%10 (1%10 then it will give 1)
        --fact will be initilized with 1
        -- again entering into forloop with the range(1,r+1), here r is 1
            --nested forloop to inner while loop 1st iteration fact = fact * j, here 1*1 = 1
             --After complition of nested forloop controller will come to next statement
        sum = sum + fact (here sum is 144 ) 144+1, so sum will become 145
         i will become reduced based on (i= i//10) i value will be 0

         -- again while condition will be checked i>0 false.

    so controller will come out of inner whileloop and move to next if condition num == sum
    here num value is 145 and sum value will also will be 145, then if condition True, enter into if block, then print num.

Then the controller will come out of outer for loop also.
